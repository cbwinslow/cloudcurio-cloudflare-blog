## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features
- Use `const` by default, `let` when reassignment is needed
- Use async/await instead of promises chains
- Use template literals for string interpolation
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Fetches blog posts from the database
 * @param {Object} env - Cloudflare environment bindings
 * @param {number} limit - Maximum number of posts to return
 * @returns {Promise<Array>} Array of blog posts
 */
async function getBlogPosts(env, limit = 50) {
    const { results } = await env.DB.prepare(`
        SELECT * FROM blog_posts LIMIT ?
    `).bind(limit).all();
    
    return results;
}
```

### HTML/CSS

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Follow BEM naming convention for CSS classes
- Keep CSS organized by component
- Use CSS custom properties for theming

### File Organization

```
/public/              - Static assets
  /css/               - Stylesheets
  /js/                - Client-side JavaScript
  /blog/              - Blog-related pages
  index.html          - Main entry point

/functions/           - Cloudflare Pages Functions
  /api/               - API endpoints
    /blog/            - Blog-related APIs
    /knowledge/       - Knowledge base APIs
    
/src/                 - Source code
  /workers/           - Background workers
